# 💼 `wallets` - Add user wallets with money-like balances to your Rails app

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/wallets.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/wallets) [![Build Status](https://github.com/rameerez/wallets/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rameerez/wallets/actions)

> [!TIP]
> **🚀 Ship your next Rails app 10x faster!** I've built **[RailsFast](https://railsfast.com/?ref=wallets)**, a production-ready Rails boilerplate template that comes with everything you need to launch a software business in days, not weeks. Go [check it out](https://railsfast.com/?ref=wallets)!

Allow your users to have wallets with money-like balances for value holding and transferring. `wallets` gives any Rails model money-like wallets backed by an append-oriented transaction ledger. You can use these wallets to store and transfer value in any "currency" (points inside your app, call minutes, in-game resources, in-app assets, etc.)

![wallets](wallets.webp)

Use it for:

- **Rewards & loyalty points**: Cashback, points, store credit, referral bonuses
- **Marketplace balances**: Seller earnings, buyer credits, platform payouts
- **Gig economy**: Driver earnings, rider credits, tip wallets
- **Multi-currency balances**: EUR, USD, GBP wallets per user
- **Game resources**: Wood, stone, gems, gold, energy; any virtual economy
- **Telecom / SIM data plans**: "This plan gives you 10 GB per month, transfer unused data to friends"

At its core, `wallets` provides your users with: a wallet with balance, a log of transactions, expirable balances, and transfers between users.

For example, imagine you're building a SIM card app with data plans. At the beginning of each month, you give your users expirable data and call minutes:

```ruby
user.wallet(:mb).credit(10_240, expires_at: month_end)   # 10 GB in MB
user.wallet(:minutes).credit(500, expires_at: month_end) # 500 call minutes
```

Users can transfer their unused balance to friends:

```ruby
user.wallet(:mb).transfer_to(friend.wallet(:mb), 3_072)  # Send 3 GB
```

And balances decrease as they're consumed:

```ruby
user.wallet(:mb).debit(512, category: :network_usage)
user.wallet(:mb).balance  # => 6656 MB remaining
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to implement usage credits in your app, use the [`usage_credits`](https://github.com/rameerez/usage_credits) gem! It uses `wallets` under the hood, and on top provides very handy DX ergonomics for recurring credits fulfillment, credit pack purchases, `pay` integration for charging users for credits, etc. `wallets` sits at the core of the `usage_credits` gem. It's meant to handle a generalized version of any digital in-app currency, not just credits. If you don't know whether you should use the `wallets` gem or the `usage_credits` gem, check out the [`wallets` vs `usage_credits`](#wallets-vs-usage_credits--which-gem-do-i-need) section below.

## Why this gem

`wallets` gives you more than `users.balance += 1`, but less than a full banking system:

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Multi-asset** | One wallet per asset: `user.wallet(:usd)`, `user.wallet(:gems)` |
| **Append-oriented ledger API** | Every balance change made through the wallet API creates a transaction row |
| **Expiration-aware allocation** | Debits consume soonest-expiring credits first, then the oldest bucket |
| **Linked transfers** | Both sides of a transfer are recorded and queryable |
| **Row-level locking** | Prevents race conditions and double-spending |
| **Balance snapshots** | Each transaction records before/after balance for reconciliation |
| **Rich metadata** | Attach any JSON to transactions for audit and filtering |

## Quick start

Add the gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "wallets"
```

Requires Ruby 3.2+ and Rails 7.2.3.1–8.x. Ruby 3.2 is the security floor because current patched versions of transitive Rails dependencies no longer support Ruby 3.1.

Then run:

```bash
bundle install
rails generate wallets:install
rails db:migrate
```

Add `has_wallets` to any model that should own wallets:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :coins
end
```

That gives you:

```ruby
user.wallet           # => same as user.main_wallet
user.main_wallet      # => wallet(:coins)

user.wallet(:coins).credit(100, category: :reward)
user.wallet(:coins).debit(25, category: :purchase)

user.wallet(:wood).credit(20, category: :quest_reward)
user.wallet(:gems).credit(5, category: :top_up)
```

## Example

Here is a more relatable money flow for a home-cleaning app:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :eur_cents
end

class Platform < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :eur_cents
end

sara = User.find(1)      # customer
lucia = User.find(2)     # cleaner
platform = Platform.first

# Sara books a cleaning and tops up her wallet
sara.wallet.credit(10_000, category: :top_up, metadata: { source: "card" })

# Sara books a 2-hour cleaning for €60.00
booking_total = 6_000
platform_fee = 900
cleaner_payout = booking_total - platform_fee

# Sara pays the platform the gross booking price
charge = sara.wallet.transfer_to(
  platform.wallet,
  booking_total,
  category: :cleaning_booking_charge,
  metadata: { booking_id: 42, cleaner_id: lucia.id }
)

# The app later pays Lucia the net amount and keeps its fee
payout = platform.wallet.transfer_to(
  lucia.wallet,
  cleaner_payout,
  category: :cleaner_payout,
  metadata: {
    booking_id: 42,
    customer_id: sara.id,
    gross_transfer_id: charge.id,
    platform_fee: platform_fee
  }
)

# Query the linked transfer records later
charge.outbound_transaction
payout.inbound_transactions
```

Amounts are always integers. For money, store the smallest unit like cents. For games, store whole resource units.

## API

### Owners

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :credits
end
```

Options:

- `default_asset:` asset returned by `user.wallet` and `user.main_wallet`
- `auto_create:` whether the main wallet should be created automatically
- `initial_balance:` optional starting balance for the auto-created main wallet

### Lookup wallets

```ruby
user.wallet            # => default asset wallet
user.main_wallet       # => same as user.wallet
user.wallet(:eur)      # => auto-creates the EUR wallet if needed
user.wallet?(:gems)    # => whether a wallet already exists
user.find_wallet(:usd) # => returns nil instead of auto-creating
```

### Credit and debit

```ruby
wallet = user.wallet(:gems)

wallet.credit(100, category: :reward)
wallet.debit(20, category: :purchase)

wallet.balance
wallet.history
wallet.has_enough_balance?(50)
```

Every transaction can carry metadata:

```ruby
wallet.credit(
  500,
  category: :top_up,
  metadata: { source: "promo_campaign", campaign_id: 12 }
)
```

### Transfers

For internal app payments, transfers are the main primitive:

```ruby
sender = user.wallet(:eur)
receiver = other_user.wallet(:eur)

transfer = sender.transfer_to(
  receiver,
  2_000,
  category: :peer_payment,
  metadata: { message: "Dinner split" }
)

transfer.outbound_transaction
transfer.inbound_transactions
```

`category:` on `transfer_to` describes the **business meaning of the transfer itself**. The ledger entries created underneath are still recorded as `transfer_out` and `transfer_in`, and the original transfer category is mirrored into transaction metadata as `transfer_category`.

That means you can query transfers directly for business flows:

```ruby
user.wallet.outgoing_transfers.where(category: :peer_payment)
user.wallet.incoming_transfers.where(category: :peer_payment)
```

Or query the ledger legs when you need transaction-level audit data:

```ruby
user.wallet.history
    .by_category(:transfer_in)
    .where("metadata->>'transfer_category' = ?", "peer_payment")
```

Transfers require both wallets to use the same asset and the same wallet class. `:eur` can move to `:eur`; `:wood` can move to `:wood`; `Wallets::Wallet` cannot transfer directly to `UsageCredits::Wallet`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Transfer expiration behavior:** Transfers preserve expiration buckets by default. If a single transfer consumes multiple source buckets with different expirations, the receiver gets multiple inbound credit transactions so those expirations remain intact.
>
> You can override that per transfer:
>
> ```ruby
> sender.transfer_to(receiver, 100, expiration_policy: :none)           # evergreen on receive
> sender.transfer_to(receiver, 100, expires_at: 30.days.from_now)       # fixed expiration on receive
> sender.transfer_to(receiver, 100, expiration_policy: :fixed, expires_at: 30.days.from_now)
> ```

### Negative balances and overdraft

By default `wallets` rejects any debit or transfer that would push a wallet below zero. Some apps (ride-fare apps with rewards, family wallets with shared spend, telecom plans with bridging credit, etc.) want to allow a small overdraft so the user experience doesn't hard-stop on a low balance.

Flip one flag and it applies consistently to direct `wallet.debit` and to `wallet.transfer_to`:

```ruby
Wallets.configure do |config|
  config.allow_negative_balance = true
end

passenger.wallet(:eur).balance       # => 100  (1€)
passenger.wallet(:eur).transfer_to(driver.wallet(:eur), 300, category: :ride_fare)
passenger.wallet(:eur).reload.balance # => -200 (-2€)
driver.wallet(:eur).reload.balance    # => 300  (3€)
```

A few things to know:

- **Apps own the floor.** The flag is binary — it doesn't cap how negative a wallet can go. If you want a "5€ convenience overdraft", enforce that in your domain code before calling `transfer_to` (e.g. a `WalletPolicy.can_afford?(wallet:, amount:)` service that checks `wallet.balance + MAX_OVERDRAFT >= amount`).
- **`has_enough_balance?` stays strict.** It answers "does this wallet have enough on hand right now?" — overdraft is a deliberate choice the caller makes by attempting the debit/transfer, not by querying. So `wallet.has_enough_balance?(amount)` returns `false` even when the gem would happily complete an overdraft.
- **`:preserve` expiration falls back to `:none` when a transfer goes negative.** With `allow_negative_balance = true` and the default `:preserve` policy, transfers that exceed the source's positive buckets can't honestly "preserve" an expiration on the deficit portion (there is no source bucket). The transfer's `expiration_policy` is automatically downgraded to `:none` for that transfer; the receiver gets a single evergreen credit. Explicit `:fixed` (with `expires_at:`) and `:none` are honored as-is.
- **`:balance_depleted` fires on positive→non-positive crossings**, not on exact zero. A debit that takes a wallet from +100 to -50 in one shot still fires the callback. With `allow_negative_balance = false` the behavior collapses back to "exactly zero" (since balances can't go below zero), so existing callers don't see a change.
- **`:low_balance_reached` is one-shot per crossing**, regardless of how deep the dip goes. Going from +200 to -100 fires once; the next debit from -100 to -200 does not re-fire because the wallet was already below threshold.
- **`:insufficient_balance` callback.** Fires only when a debit or transfer is actually rejected (i.e. flag off or your service-layer floor refused). Successful overdraft transfers do not fire it.
- **Credits don't auto-settle prior debt.** If a wallet is at -50 and you `credit(80)`, the wallet's balance becomes 30 — but the unbacked -50 debit and the +80 credit persist as independent ledger rows. The next debit consumes from the +80 bucket without back-filling the older unbacked debit. The math is consistent; the audit story is "we never settled the original debt with this credit". If you want auto-settlement, do it in your service layer (e.g. when crediting, `wallet.transactions.where("amount < 0").where("ABS(amount) > spent_amount") …` and create allocations explicitly).
- **System-initiated reversals.** Refunds and payout reversals via `transfer_to` will also go through, even if the recipient's wallet ends up below zero. That's correct: the ledger has to settle, and a negative wallet records a real debt instead of a silent failure. Apps that want to *block* user-initiated overdrafts but *allow* system reversals should keep the floor check in their service layer, not toggle the flag mid-request.
- **Don't toggle the flag at runtime while wallets are negative.** `allow_negative_balance` is meant to be a stable config decision. The model carries a `balance >= 0` validation gated on the flag; flipping it OFF while wallets sit below zero leaves them un-saveable until you flip it back on (any subsequent `credit` / `debit` calls `refresh_cached_balance!`, which raises a `RecordInvalid`). If you need to turn the flag off, drain or settle any negative wallets first.
- **Concurrency holds.** `wallet.debit` / `wallet.credit` use `with_lock` (row-level `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`); `wallet.transfer_to` locks both wallets in id order via `lock_wallet_pair!`. Two concurrent overdraft debits on the same wallet serialize cleanly — they don't double-count `previous_balance`.

### Expiring balances

Credits can expire:

```ruby
user.wallet(:coins).credit(
  1_000,
  category: :season_reward,
  expires_at: 30.days.from_now
)
```

Debits allocate against the oldest available, non-expired credits first.

## Configuration

Create or edit `config/initializers/wallets.rb`:

```ruby
Wallets.configure do |config|
  config.default_asset = :coins

  # Useful for direct credit/debit events in your app.
  # Transfer business categories live on Wallets::Transfer.category.
  config.additional_categories = %w[
    quest_reward
    provider_bonus
    payout
    promo_credit
  ]

  config.allow_negative_balance = false
  config.low_balance_threshold = 50
  config.transfer_expiration_policy = :preserve
end
```

## Callbacks

`wallets` ships with lifecycle callbacks you can use for notifications, analytics, or product logic.

Successful callbacks run after the outermost database transaction commits. If a caller wraps a wallet operation in a larger transaction and later rolls it back, no success callback is emitted. Callback exceptions are logged and isolated from the already-committed ledger write. `on_insufficient_balance` remains immediate because it describes a rejected operation rather than a committed row.

```ruby
Wallets.configure do |config|
  config.on_balance_credited do |ctx|
    Rails.logger.info("Wallet #{ctx.wallet.id} credited by #{ctx.amount}")
  end

  config.on_balance_debited do |ctx|
    Rails.logger.info("Wallet #{ctx.wallet.id} debited by #{ctx.amount}")
  end

  config.on_transfer_completed do |ctx|
    Rails.logger.info("Transfer #{ctx.transfer.id} completed")
  end

  config.on_low_balance_reached do |ctx|
    UserMailer.low_balance(ctx.wallet.owner).deliver_later
  end

  config.on_insufficient_balance do |ctx|
    Rails.logger.warn("Insufficient balance: #{ctx.metadata[:required]}")
  end
end
```

Useful fields on `ctx` include:

- `ctx.wallet`
- `ctx.transfer`
- `ctx.amount`
- `ctx.previous_balance`
- `ctx.new_balance`
- `ctx.transaction`
- `ctx.category`
- `ctx.metadata`

## wallets vs usage_credits — which gem do I need?

Both gems handle balances, but they solve different problems:

```

| Aspect | `wallets` | `usage_credits` |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Core job** | Store and move value | Sell and consume value |
| **Balance model** | Multi-asset (`:gb`, `:eur`, `:gems`) | Single asset (credits) |
| **Consumption** | Passive — balance depletes over time | Active — `spend_credits_on(:operation)` |
| **Transfers** | Built-in between users | Not designed for this |
| **Subscriptions** | You handle externally | Built-in with Stripe via `pay` |
| **Operations DSL** | None | `operation :send_email { costs 1.credit }` |
| **Best for** | B2C: games, telecom, rewards, marketplaces | B2B: SaaS, APIs, AI apps |

### When to use `wallets` alone

Use `wallets` directly when your product:
- Needs **multiple asset types** — `user.wallet(:wood)`, `user.wallet(:gold)`, `user.wallet(:eur)`
- Has **passive consumption** — balance depletes from usage over time (data, minutes, energy)
- Needs **user-to-user transfers** — gifting, P2P payments, marketplace settlements
- Manages its own subscription logic — or doesn't need subscriptions at all

### When to use `usage_credits`

Use `usage_credits` when your product:
- Sells **credits for specific operations** — "Process image costs 10 credits"
- Needs **Stripe subscriptions** with automatic credit fulfillment
- Wants the **operations DSL** — `spend_credits_on(:generate_report)`
- Is a **B2B/SaaS/API product** with usage-based pricing

### When to use both together

For products like a **SIM/telecom app**, you might use both:

```ruby
# usage_credits handles ACQUISITION (how users get balance)
subscription_plan :basic_data do
  stripe_price "price_xyz"
  gives 10_000.credits.every(:month)  # 10 GB in MB
end

# wallet-level movement is still available underneath usage_credits
user.credit_wallet.transfer_to(friend.credit_wallet, 3_000)  # Gift 3 GB
user.credit_wallet.balance  # => 7000 MB remaining
```

> [!TIP]
> `usage_credits` uses `wallets` as its ledger core. If you only need `usage_credits`, you get `wallets` for free underneath. Wallet-level methods like `user.credit_wallet.transfer_to(...)` are still available there, but the transfer DX intentionally lives at the wallet layer rather than the credits DSL.

## Real-world examples

### Telecom / Mobile data app

A SIM card app where users get monthly data and can transfer unused GBs to friends:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :data_mb  # Store in MB for precision
end

# Monthly plan grants 10 GB (stored as 10,240 MB)
user.wallet(:data_mb).credit(
  10_240,
  category: :monthly_plan,
  expires_at: 1.month.from_now,
  metadata: { plan: "basic", period: "2024-03" }
)

# Network usage consumes data passively
user.wallet(:data_mb).debit(512, category: :network_usage)

# User transfers 3 GB to a friend
user.wallet(:data_mb).transfer_to(
  friend.wallet(:data_mb),
  3_072,
  category: :gift,
  metadata: { message: "Here's some extra data!" }
)

user.wallet(:data_mb).balance  # => 6656 MB (6.5 GB remaining)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Store data in the smallest practical unit (MB or KB, not GB as a float). `wallets` uses integers to avoid floating-point issues.

### Game economy

A farming/strategy game with multiple resources:

```ruby
class Player < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :gold
end

# Quest rewards multiple resources
player.wallet(:wood).credit(100, category: :quest_reward, metadata: { quest: "forest_patrol" })
player.wallet(:stone).credit(50, category: :quest_reward)
player.wallet(:gold).credit(25, category: :quest_reward)

# Crafting consumes resources
player.wallet(:wood).debit(30, category: :crafting, metadata: { item: "wooden_sword" })

# Premium currency from in-app purchase
player.wallet(:gems).credit(500, category: :purchase, metadata: { sku: "gem_pack_500" })

# Seasonal event with expiring currency
player.wallet(:snowflakes).credit(
  1_000,
  category: :event_reward,
  expires_at: Date.new(2024, 1, 7)  # Winter event ends
)

# Trading between players
player.wallet(:gold).transfer_to(
  other_player.wallet(:gold),
  100,
  category: :trade,
  metadata: { item_received: "rare_armor" }
)
```

### Home services booking app

A home-services app where the platform collects the customer payment, keeps its fee, and later pays the provider:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :usd_cents
end

class Marketplace < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :usd_cents
end

sara = User.find(1)        # customer
lucia = User.find(2)       # cleaner
booking = Booking.find(42)
marketplace = Marketplace.first

# Booking completed
booking_total = 5000  # $50.00
platform_fee = (booking_total * 0.10).to_i  # 10%
provider_earnings = booking_total - platform_fee

# Customer pays the marketplace
charge = sara.wallet(:usd_cents).transfer_to(
  marketplace.wallet(:usd_cents),
  booking_total,
  category: :booking_charge,
  metadata: {
    booking_id: booking.id,
    provider_id: lucia.id
  }
)

# Marketplace pays the cleaner the net amount
payout = marketplace.wallet(:usd_cents).transfer_to(
  lucia.wallet(:usd_cents),
  provider_earnings,
  category: :provider_payout,
  metadata: {
    booking_id: booking.id,
    gross_amount: booking_total,
    platform_fee: platform_fee,
    customer_id: sara.id,
    booking_charge_transfer_id: charge.id
  }
)

# Cleaner later cashes out to Stripe
lucia.wallet(:usd_cents).debit(
  lucia.wallet(:usd_cents).balance,
  category: :payout,
  metadata: { stripe_transfer_id: "tr_xxx" }
)
```

### Loyalty programs & Reward points

Whether you're building a Starbucks-style loyalty program, credit card rewards, airline miles, or a Sweatcoin-style earn-from-actions app — it's the same pattern:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Loyalty program flow                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  EARN              │  Purchase, action, referral, promo     │
│  HOLD              │  Points accumulate, some may expire    │
│  TRANSFER          │  Gift to family, pool with friends     │
│  REDEEM            │  Rewards, discounts, gift cards        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :points
end

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EARN — from purchases, actions, referrals
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Points from purchase (1 point per dollar)
user.wallet(:points).credit(
  order.total_cents / 100,
  category: :purchase,
  metadata: { order_id: order.id }
)

# Bonus points for specific products
user.wallet(:points).credit(150, category: :bonus_item, metadata: { sku: "featured_product" })

# Referral bonus
user.wallet(:points).credit(500, category: :referral, metadata: { referred_user_id: friend.id })

# Daily check-in streaks
user.wallet(:points).credit(50 * streak_multiplier, category: :daily_checkin)

# Receipt scanning (Ibotta-style)
user.wallet(:points).credit(100, category: :receipt_scan, metadata: { receipt_id: 123 })

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXPIRING PROMOS — use-it-or-lose-it campaigns
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Welcome bonus that expires in 30 days
user.wallet(:points).credit(
  500,
  category: :welcome_bonus,
  expires_at: 30.days.from_now
)

# Double points weekend (expires Monday)
user.wallet(:points).credit(
  200,
  category: :promo,
  expires_at: Date.current.next_occurring(:monday),
  metadata: { campaign: "double_points_weekend" }
)

# Birthday reward
user.wallet(:points).credit(

)

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TRANSFER — gift to friends, pool with family
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Gift points to another member
user.wallet(:points).transfer_to(
  friend.wallet(:points),
  500,
  category: :gift,
  metadata: { message: "Happy birthday!" }
)

# Family pooling (multiple transfers to a shared account)
family_members.each do |member|
  member.wallet(:points).transfer_to(
    family_pool.wallet(:points),
    member.wallet(:points).balance,
    category: :family_pool
  )
end

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# REDEEM — rewards, discounts, cash out
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Redeem for a reward
user.wallet(:points).debit(
  2500,
  category: :redemption,
  metadata: { reward: "free_coffee", reward_id: 42 }
)

# Redeem for statement credit / gift card
user.wallet(:points).debit(
  10_000,
  category: :cash_out,
  metadata: { gift_card_code: "XXXX-YYYY", value_cents: 1000 }
)

# Partial redemption with points + cash
points_portion = 500
user.wallet(:points).debit(
  points_portion,
  category: :partial_redemption,
  metadata: { order_id: order.id, points_value_cents: points_portion }
)
```

**Loyalty-specific patterns:**

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Tiered earning** | `credit(amount * tier_multiplier, ...)` |
| **Points expiration** | `expires_at: 1.year.from_now` |
| **Family pooling** | `transfer_to` family wallet |
| **Gifting** | `transfer_to` friend's wallet |
| **Earn + burn in one transaction** | `debit` points, `credit` new promo points |

### Gig economy / Driver earnings

An Uber/DoorDash-style app with earnings and tips:

```ruby
class Driver < ApplicationRecord
  has_wallets default_asset: :usd_cents
end

# Ride completed
driver.wallet(:usd_cents).credit(
  1250,  # $12.50 base fare
  category: :ride_fare,
  metadata: { ride_id: ride.id, distance_miles: 5.2 }
)

# Tip added later
driver.wallet(:usd_cents).credit(
  300,  # $3.00 tip
  category: :tip,
  metadata: { ride_id: ride.id, rider_id: rider.id }
)

# Weekly payout
driver.wallet(:usd_cents).debit(
  driver.wallet(:usd_cents).balance,
  category: :weekly_payout,
  metadata: { payout_date: Date.current, bank_account: "****1234" }
)
```

## Perfect use cases

`wallets` is best for **closed-loop value** inside your app — where the app itself is the source of truth.

| Use case | Example | Why `wallets` fits |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Telecom / data plans** | Mobile data that users can share | Multi-asset (`:data_mb`, `:sms`, `:minutes`), transfers, expiration |
| **Game economies** | FarmVille, Fortnite, OGame | Multiple resources, trading between players |
| **Marketplaces** | Etsy, Fiverr, Airbnb | Seller earnings, buyer credits, platform settlements |
| **Rewards / loyalty** | Sweatcoin, credit card points | Points from actions, expiring promos, redemptions |
| **Gig economy** | Uber, DoorDash | Driver earnings, tips, scheduled payouts |
| **Multi-currency** | Travel apps, international platforms | Per-currency wallets (`:eur`, `:usd`, `:gbp`) |
| **Store credit** | Gift cards, refund credits | Simple balance with full audit trail |

**Key signals that `wallets` is the right fit:**
- Users hold **multiple types of value** (not just one "credits" balance)
- Users **transfer value to each other** (gifts, trades, P2P payments)
- Value **expires** (promotional credits, seasonal currencies, data rollovers)
- You need a **full audit trail** (not just a cached integer)
- The app is the **source of truth** (not syncing with external ledgers)

## When NOT to use `wallets`

### Use `usage_credits` instead if:

- You're building a **SaaS/API product** with usage-based pricing
- You need **Stripe subscriptions** with automatic credit fulfillment
- You want an **operations DSL** like `spend_credits_on(:generate_report)`
- Your users **buy credits to perform specific actions** (not hold transferable balances)

See [usage_credits](https://github.com/rameerez/usage_credits) — it uses `wallets` underneath.

### Use something else entirely if:

`wallets` is the wrong abstraction when the hard part is external money movement, regulation, or accounting-grade settlement:

- **Banking infrastructure** — transfers to/from bank rails, cards, ACH, SEPA
- **Regulated stored-value** — KYC, AML, licensing, custody requirements
- **Escrow systems** — pending, available, reserved, delayed-release states
- **FX conversion** — multi-currency conversion with exchange rates
- **Full accounting** — charts of accounts, journal entries, financial reporting
- **Blockchain/crypto** — consensus, custody, cryptographic guarantees

### Skip both gems if:

- You just need **one cached integer** (`users.balance += 1`) and don't care about history, audits, or transfers
- Your "balance" is just a counter for display purposes

**Rule of thumb:**
- "How do I track balances and transfers inside my app?" → `wallets`
- "How do I sell credits for API/SaaS operations?" → `usage_credits`
- "How do I build payments infrastructure?" → Neither (you need a banking partner)

## Is this production-ready?

Yes, this is production-ready for internal app balances and user-to-user value transfer inside your product. It is substantially more trustworthy than a single integer column because it gives you an append-oriented transaction ledger, expiration-aware allocation, linked transfer records, balance snapshots, and row-level locking.

In practice, that means you get:

- a full transaction history instead of just a cached balance
- FEFO consumption of the soonest-expiring balance buckets, with oldest-first ties
- linked debit/credit records for transfers between users
- concurrency protection when multiple writes hit the same wallet
- enough structure to support marketplace balances, peer payments, rewards, and in-game assets inside a real production app

If your product needs users to hold value, earn value, spend value, or transmit value to other users inside your own app, this is the sort of foundation you want instead of `users.balance += 1`.

The wallet API is append-oriented, but the gem does not turn Active Record or your database into a tamper-proof store: application code with model/SQL access can still update rows, and destroying an owner intentionally cascades through that owner's wallet history. Use soft deletion or an application-level destroy restriction when records must be retained; also restrict write access, retain backups, reconcile against external processors, and use database/audit controls appropriate to your risk model. If you need legally immutable records, regulated custody, or accounting-grade journals, use purpose-built infrastructure.

## Can it support payments between users?

Yes. `transfer_to` lets you move value between users while keeping both sides of the movement linked in the ledger. That makes it suitable for peer payments, marketplace payouts, seller balances, rewards, and in-game trades inside your own app.

But it is not a blockchain and not a full payments stack.

What it does not do for you:

- external settlement to banks or cards
- KYC/AML/compliance
- escrow, reserves, or held balances
- FX conversion between assets
- disputes, chargebacks, or processor reconciliation
- cryptographic consensus or custody guarantees

So the right framing is: strong internal wallet/accounting primitive, not money infrastructure by itself.

## Embedding `wallets` in your own gem

`wallets` is built to be embeddable: other gems can reuse the ledger core (expiration-aware allocation, locking, transfers, callbacks) on top of their **own** tables, config, and event names. This is exactly how [`usage_credits`](https://github.com/rameerez/usage_credits) works — its `UsageCredits::Wallet` is a `Wallets::WalletBase` subclass living in `usage_credits_*` tables.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Subclass the abstract `*Base` classes** (`Wallets::WalletBase`, `Wallets::TransactionBase`, `Wallets::AllocationBase`, `Wallets::TransferBase`) — **not** the concrete `Wallets::Wallet` etc. ActiveRecord builds a subclass's attribute methods on its parent's, so subclassing a concrete model forces a schema load of the `wallets_*` tables — which don't exist in apps that only install your gem. The abstract parents make each embedded model its own `base_class`, so the base tables are never consulted.

These class-level hooks are a supported, stable contract (covered by tests — breaking them is a breaking change for downstream gems):

```ruby
class MyGem::Wallet < Wallets::WalletBase
  self.embedded_table_name = "my_gem_wallets"            # your table, not wallets_wallets
  self.config_provider = -> { MyGem.configuration }      # your config object
  self.callbacks_module = MyGem::Callbacks               # your callback dispatcher
  self.transaction_class_name = "MyGem::Transaction"     # your subclasses
  self.allocation_class_name = "MyGem::Allocation"
  self.transfer_class_name = "MyGem::Transfer"

  # Rename (or silence, with nil) core events for your domain:
  self.callback_event_map = {
    credited: :coins_added,
    debited: :coins_spent,
    insufficient: :not_enough_coins,
    low_balance: :low_balance,
    depleted: :out_of_coins,
    transfer_completed: nil  # nil = don't dispatch this event
  }.freeze

  class << self
    private

    # Customize the ledger entry recorded for `create_for_owner!(initial_balance:)`
    def initial_balance_credit_attributes
      { category: :starting_coins, metadata: { reason: "initial_balance" } }
    end
  end
end
```

Your `Transaction`, `Allocation`, and `Transfer` subclasses (of `Wallets::TransactionBase`, `Wallets::AllocationBase`, `Wallets::TransferBase`) set `embedded_table_name` (and `config_provider` / `transaction_class_name` where relevant) the same way.

One current limitation to be aware of: the core models declare their associations against the `Wallets::*` class names, so your subclasses should **re-declare associations** with your own classes (`belongs_to :wallet, class_name: "MyGem::Wallet"`, etc.) so that records load as your subclasses rather than the core ones. See `usage_credits`' models for the canonical embedding pattern.

## TODO

- Dynamic association class resolution for embedded subclasses (so embedders don't need to re-declare associations)
- First-class transfer reversal/refund API built on compensating ledger entries
- Optional pending/held balance primitives for escrow-like flows
- Multi-step transfer policies beyond `:preserve`, `:none`, and fixed `expires_at`

## Development

Run the test suite:
